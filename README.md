## Deployment
### Local deployment
1. Clone git repository:
    ```
    https://github.com/Sloydeath/Pets-Spring.git
    ```
2. Install PostgreSQL and create database pets_db.
3. Change spring.datasource.username and spring.datasource.password in file:
    ```
    src/main/resources/application-dev.properties
    ```
   P.S.: If you have changed post of db (by default 5432) 
   or name of database (pets_db), you should update 
   spring.datasource.url in the same file from point â„–3:
   ```
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/pets_db
   ```
4. Build project with command:
    ```
    mvn clean install
    ```
5. Launch project with command:
    ```
    java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=dev target/Pets-Spring-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```
6. If you want to test app, you should install postman and import files:
    ```
    postman/Pets Local.postman_collection.json
    postman/URLS_FOR_PETS_API.postman_environment.json
    ```
   
### Cloud Foundry deployment
1. Clone git repository:
    ```
    https://github.com/Sloydeath/Pets-Spring.git
    ```
2. Build project with command:
    ```
    mvn clean install
    ```
3. Install cf CLI on your computer.
4. Sign up on the site and create trial account:
   ```
   https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com/
   ```
5. To log in to the cf CLI:
    * Run in cmd:
      ```
      cf login -a API-URL -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -o ORG -s SPACE
      ```
      Where:
    * API-URL is your API endpoint, the URL of the Cloud Controller in your Cloud Foundry instance
    * USERNAME is your username.
    * PASSWORD is your password. Cloud Foundry discourages using the -p option, as it may record your password in your shell history.
    * ORG is the org where you want to deploy your apps.
    * SPACE is the space in the org where you want to deploy your apps.
    * More information you can find in CF documentation:
      ```
      https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/getting-started.html
      ```
6. Open cmd in the root folder of project and run:
   ```
   cf push
   ```
7. If you want to test app, you should install postman and import files:
    ```
    postman/Pets_CF.postman_collection.json
    postman/URLS_FOR_PETS_API.postman_environment.json
    ```
