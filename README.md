## Pets Spring API

## Requirements
### For local deployment:
* Java 1.8
* Spring Boot 2.5.1
* Maven 3.8.1
* PostgreSQL 11.12

### For Cloud Foundry deployment:
* Java 1.8
* Spring Boot 2.5.1
* Maven 3.8.1
* H2 database
* CF version 7.2.0+be4a5ce2b.2020-12-10 (Cloud Foundry)

## Deployment

There are 3 profiles: dev, prod, cloud.
* dev profile - uses local database PostgreSQL;
* prod profile - uses H2 database in CF;
* cloud profile - uses PostgreSQL database in CF.

### Local deployment
1. Clone git repository:
    ```
    https://github.com/Sloydeath/Pets-Spring.git
    ```
2. Install PostgreSQL and create database pets_db.
3. Connect to database from Intellij.
4. Change spring.datasource.username and spring.datasource.password in file:
    ```
    src/main/resources/application-dev.properties
    ```
   P.S.: If you have changed post of db (by default 5432) 
   or name of database (pets_db), you should update 
   spring.datasource.url in the same file from point â„–3:
   ```
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/pets_db
   ```
5. Build project with command:
    ```
    mvn -Pdev clean spring-boot:run
    ```
6. If you want to test app, you should install postman and import files:
    ```
    postman/Pets Local.postman_collection.json
    postman/URLS_FOR_PETS_API.postman_environment.json
    ```
   
### Cloud Foundry deployment
1. Clone git repository:
    ```
    https://github.com/Sloydeath/Pets-Spring.git
    ```

2. If you want to run app in cf with H2 database, you should delete postgres service from manifest.yml.
   If you want to rup app in cf with Postgres database, you should add postgres service in manifest.yml
3. Build project with command:


    mvn -P<profile name> clean install

    <profile name> - prod (with H2 database) or cloud (with PostgreSQL)
    (For example: mvn -Pcloud clean install)

4. Install cf CLI on your computer.
5. Sign up on the site and create trial account:
   ```
   https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com/
   ```
6. To log in to the cf CLI:
    * Run in cmd:
      ```
      cf login -a API-URL -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -o ORG -s SPACE
      ```
      Where:
    * API-URL is your API endpoint, the URL of the Cloud Controller in your Cloud Foundry instance
    * USERNAME is your username.
    * PASSWORD is your password. Cloud Foundry discourages using the -p option, as it may record your password in your shell history.
    * ORG is the org where you want to deploy your apps.
    * SPACE is the space in the org where you want to deploy your apps.
    * More information you can find in CF documentation:
      ```
      https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/getting-started.html
      ```
7. If you want to run application with cloud profile, you should run this command in CMD:
   ```
   cf ssh -L 63306:postgres-a8cbc12a-eb4e-466b-9d1b-42f8d4edb141.ce4jcviyvogb.eu-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com:2439 pets-spring-leverx
   ```
8. Open cmd in the root folder of project and run:
   ```
   cf push
   ```
9. If you want to test app, you should install postman and import files:
    ```
    postman/Pets_CF.postman_collection.json
    postman/URLS_FOR_PETS_API.postman_environment.json
    ```
